Implement  a  sorting  robotic  arm  to  sort  the  objects  based  on  the  color.  The manipulator  should  be  build  from  scratch.  The  input  of  the  system  can  be  locations  of  the objects  and  color  based  destination  points.  The  system  should  be  tested  with  minimum  of three  different  colors.
